description: >-
  Hello, my name is Anthony Suárez. I am a college student with a strong passion
  for learning and software engineering. I've been interested in programming
  since I was 13 years old, which is when I started learning via online courses
  like Codecademy. I noticed that coding was hard sometimes, and that's what
  encouraged me to keep learning, because I've always thought difficult topics
  are really fun. Approximately a year ago, I decided programming is going to
  become my profession.


  I have the ability to learn really fast. I taught myself English, I'm
  currently learning Japanese, and I'm always working on software projects,
  learning new and exciting topics.


  I've come really far and I know I'm ready to take the next step: working in a
  professional environment. I may not have a college degree, but I have what I
  think is most essential: passion and determination.
