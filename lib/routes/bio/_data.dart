      Hello, my name is Anthony Su√°rez. I am a college student with a strong passion for learning and software engineering. I've been interested in programming since I was 13 years old, which is when I started learning via online courses like Codecademy. I noticed that coding was hard sometimes, and that's what encouraged me to keep learning, because I've always thought difficult topics are really fun. Approximately a year ago, I programming is going to become my profession.

      I have the ability to learn really fast. I taught myself English, I'm currently learning Japanese, and I'm always working on software projects, learning new and exciting topics.

      I've come really far and I know I'm ready to take the next step: working in a professional environment. I may not have a college degree, but I have what I think is most essential: passion and determination.

      Below you can see some of my abilities and achievements.
